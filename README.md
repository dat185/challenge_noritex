# challenge_noritex

Your task is to implement the function evaluate below to the specification
provided in the documentation string. If the documentation is in any
way ambiguous, please email Nessim Btesh for clarification.
If you feel that auxiliary helper functions would be helpful, feel free to
write them. You may change anything in this file except you are not permitted
to alter the name or function signature of evaluate().

Although we provide you with some test cases, do not assume that these cover
all corner cases, and we may use a different set of inputs to validate your
solution. We will be looking at your solution both for correctness and for
style.

Best of luck!
